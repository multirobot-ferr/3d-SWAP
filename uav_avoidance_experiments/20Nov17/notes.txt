Today we performed three experiments:

Experiment 03.
Repeating the experiment to see the bracking distance of the robot.

Experiment 04_01
Two UAV flying at different altitudes (3 and 6m). The parameters were:
<param name="swap/safety_radius" value="0.8486"/>
<param name="swap/braking_distance" value="1.25"/>   <!-- The uav is capable of breacking in 1.25m-->
<param name="swap/positioning_error" value="1.0"/> 
<param name="swap/gamma_offset" value="0.5"/>
The day was windy and the uavs did not stopped fast enough.

Experiment 04_02
Two UAV flying at different altitudes (3 and 6m). The parameters were:
<param name="swap/safety_radius" value="0.8486"/>
<param name="swap/braking_distance" value="1.25"/>   <!-- The uav is capable of breacking in 1.25m-->
<param name="swap/positioning_error" value="1.0"/> 
<param name="swap/gamma_offset" value="1.5"/>
